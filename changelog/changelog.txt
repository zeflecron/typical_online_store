// FUTURE PLANS (FOR MYSELF, AND I MIGHT NOT DO ANY OF THEM :D):
// [Done; v1.3] 1. Make login system (doesn't have to be extremely good user authentication system with encrypted password)
// 2. User can create and delete their own products
// 3. Products can have 5-star reviews from users
// [Done; v1.3] 4. Use promises to execute all the code properly (currently if one of the handler fails the other still executes, which is really bad)
// 5. Unit testing, integration testing, and/or E2E testing with Jest/Cypress/something...
// 6. Recreation using Angular and Vue (version 1.2 or later, whatever I want)
